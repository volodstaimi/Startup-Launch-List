## Why This Exists

Every founder goes through the same ritual — Googling "where to submit my startup" and piecing together scattered lists from blog posts and Twitter threads. This repo ends that.

**Startup Launch List** is a single, open-source database of every directory, review site, community, marketplace, and press outlet where you can list your product. Each entry includes Domain Rating, link type (dofollow/nofollow), pricing, and category — where we could find the data.

## 💡 Submission Strategy

A smart approach beats blasting everything at once.

### Phase 1 — Authority First (Week 1)

Submit to DR 65+ directories that are free. Maximum link equity, zero cost.

> Product Hunt, G2, AlternativeTo, Hacker News, DEV Community, SourceForge

### Phase 2 — Paid Boost (Week 2)

Spend $200-500 on high-DR paid listings for enhanced visibility and faster approval.

> Toolify, AI Stage, Tool Pilot, Capterra (especially for B2B SaaS)

### Phase 3 — Build Volume (Weeks 2-3)

Submit to 30-50 mid-tier directories. Spread over 2-3 weeks so your backlink profile grows naturally.

> Mix dofollow and nofollow — Google expects both.

### Phase 4 — Long Tail (Weeks 3-4)

Complete the rest. Even low-DR sites add link diversity and referral traffic.

### ✅ Before You Start

Prepare these once, reuse everywhere:

- [ ] Product name (keep it consistent across all listings)
- [ ] One-liner (10 words max)
- [ ] Full description (150-300 words — write 3-4 unique versions to avoid duplicate content flags)
- [ ] Logo (PNG, transparent background, high-res)
- [ ] 3-5 screenshots

## 📁 Data Formats

| Format | File | Best For |
|--------|------|----------|
| **JSON** | [`data/directories.json`](data/directories.json) | Scripts, APIs, automation |
| **CSV** | [`data/directories.csv`](data/directories.csv) | Excel, Google Sheets, quick filtering |

### Schema

```json
{
  "name": "Product Hunt",
  "url": "https://www.producthunt.com",
  "domain_rating": 91,
  "link_type": "Dofollow",
  "pricing": "Free",
  "category": "👥 Community",
  "description": "..."
}
```

### Quick Examples

**Python — Get top dofollow directories:**

```python
import json

with open("data/directories.json") as f:
    dirs = json.load(f)

dofollow = sorted(
    [d for d in dirs if d["link_type"] == "Dofollow" and d["domain_rating"]],
    key=lambda x: -x["domain_rating"]
)

for d in dofollow[:10]:
    print(f"{d['name']} (DR {d['domain_rating']}): {d['url']}")
```

**Bash — Filter CSV for dofollow links with DR > 50:**

```bash
awk -F',' '$3 > 50 && $4 == "Dofollow"' data/directories.csv
```

**JavaScript — Filter by category:**

```javascript
const dirs = require("./data/directories.json");
const aiDirs = dirs.filter(d => d.category.includes("AI"));
console.log(`${aiDirs.length} AI directories found`);
```
